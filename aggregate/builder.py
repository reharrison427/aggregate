Aggregate building module. This is the driver for building aggregates of
spherical and spheroidal aggregates using different aggregation techniques.

Currently available types are:

    build_bcca() - Ballistic cluster-cluster aggregate
    build_bpca() - Ballistic particle cluster aggregate

# TODO: look at a "sphere cylinder" intersection to see if there is an easy way (akin
# to the bounding box method for spheres) of checking for aggregate intersect and
# discarding those that can't possibly hit!

# TODO: in general consider spheroidal monomers instead of spheres

# TODO: set up a logger here, instead of global debug/prints

# TODO: Add a builder that mixes cluster and particle aggregates with some distribution

# TODO: general - add polydisperse monomers in a single aggregate

# TODO: add QBCCA? (http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/707/2/1247/pdf)

# TODO: add BAM1/BAM2 type aggregation? (allow for rolling rather than hit + stick)
